<p>This is a page about the show Euphoria. I will be going into detail of each main character from my opinion. Along with each character I will include which episode explains the backstory of characters.</p>
<h1>Rue Bennett</h1>
<a href="https://screenrant.com/euphoria-rue-best-quotes/"><img src="img/rue.png" alt="" width="200" height="201"></a>
<p>Rue is played by the actress Zendaya. Rue narrates for the majority of the show. Rue is not the best character but I don't hate her. She makes bad choices and is often insensitive but she's hilarious at times. She struggles with addiction but doesn't try to overcome it. She was in rehab and instantly went back to use. Then continued to lie to everyone that cares about her that she is ok. Rue was found mid overdose by her younger sister and chose to disregard her feelings. Season one episode one we learn how Rue first started her journey to drug addiction. She started drugs because her dad was ill with cancer and had an unlimited access. Along with that she struggles with intense OCD, depression, and anxiety. She is medicated for all of those mental illnesses, this is why she feels drugs are not a dangerous outlet. Then, she meets Jules who starts to encourage her to change her life. Though she does for a little while she quickly falls back into her old ways and continues to lie to Jules.</p>

<h1>Jules Vaughn</h1>
<a href="https://screenrant.com/euphoria-hbo-jules-episode-best-quotes/"><img src="img/jules.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="205"></a>	
<p>Jules is one of the character's I'm impartial to. Half of me dislikes her because she does something that makes her hypocritical to juding Rue for her addiction. In season one, episode four we learn that Jules spent some time as a teenager in a psych ward. She didn't like the way her body look and it caused her to go into some dark times. Her time in the psych ward led her to growing into some violent s*xual interactions, she has one during the first episode. We learn who it is later in time and she starts to get targeted by the deranged character: Nate Jacobs. The other half of me likes her because she's a good influence on Rue and encourges Rue to try harder with overcoming her addiction. Rue does start getting better and takes more action for her problems thanks to Jules. </p>

<h1>Nate Jacobs</h1>
<a href="https://screenrant.com/euphoria-quotes-maddy-nate-perfect/"><img src="img/nate.png" alt="" width="200" height="260"></a>	
<p>Nate Jacobs is an awful character, he is played by the actor Jacob Elordi. Season one, epsidoe three we get a look into Nate Jacobs growing up. He discoevrs something about his father at a young age, that has mentally scarred him. He knows that if anyone finds out what it was it will destroy his father's respected reputation. I despise him so much, but that's the point of the character. He is abusive and manipulative to his "on and off" girlfriend Maddy. He has no respect for anyone even his own friends and escpecially not girls he has relationships with. He plays football for the high school team. His dad puts a lot of pressue on him and to him Nate is never good enough.</p>

<h1>Maddy Perez</h1>
<a href="https://screenrant.com/euphoria-quotes-maddy-nate-perfect/"><img src="img/maddy.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="285"></a>
<p>Maddy is one of the characters I like. She is honest and doesn't let anyone get to her. An issue with her is her relationship with Nate Jacobs. There was an incident where he hurts her and because she feels that she is in love she lies and says it was someone else. Nate got the guy to confess to hurting Maddy by beating the guy to a pulp. Though Maddy has many issues with Nate she is still a devoted friend. Her best friend Cassie was having a huge issue, their friend Kat said awful things and Maddy didn't even think twice to stand up for Cassie. At the same time she becomes cruel to anyone that challenges her relationship to Nate. She believes she has true love with Nate, while we find out he may not feel the same way.</p>

<h1>Cassie Howards</h1>
<a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/best-euphoria-quotes/movie-and-tv-quotes"><img src="img/cassie.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="238"></a>
	<p>I like Cassie, she's just a little pathetic. She cries a lot for things she brought upon herself. She's pretty and knows what she wants but she lets people stomp all over her and it's sad. Seson one, episode seven we get a view of Cassie's past and how her father left because her mother was jealous of how he was more attractive and flirts alot , even without trying. She is secretly sleeping with her best friend's (Maddy) ex and she's letting the guilt take her over but won't do anything about it. She is also downgrading herself by trying to become Maddy in hopes Nate will show her attention in the hallway. Cassie's mother isn't a good influence on her either, she's an alocholic that doesn't stop talking. Cassie was happy with her ex McKay and right before they started dating her mother told him that Cassie is never satisfied. McKay was a good love interest for Cassie until he started getting toxic and controling out of nowhere. Then, when he got Cassie pregant he wanted no part of it. I didn't like how the show wiped Cassie's pregnancy under the rug though. It's just as serious topic as the rest and needs to be addressed. The most recent episode (Season two, Episode four spoiler) Cassie gets jealous of seeing Nate and Maddy together because Cassie and Nate are secretly together and she gets so drunk that she throws up in the hot tub and starts sobbing expecting Nate to pick her over Maddy infront of everyone.</p>

<h1>Lexi Howard</h1>
<a href="https://euphoria.fandom.com/wiki/Lexi_Howard"><img src="img/lexi.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="238"></a>
	<p>Lexi is the superior sister. She is sweet, caring, funny, and super smart. I love her so much. She is so unproblematic, nothing is wrong with her. I do feel bad because she feels that she lives on the outside. For one of the episodes she is literally narrating it as if she was casting a movie. She is writing a "play" on her life and how her sister Cassie kind of outcasts her. They are close siblings but Cassie is considered the popular and pretty sister. My favorite ship of the show is Lexi and a character named Fezco aka Fez. They radiate the same energy and are so cute togther. We don't have an episode of Lexi's past because we kind of already learn some of it from Cassie's past video but that's why we get the episode of her narrating as if she is directing a play. We get a look into how she views each character. The episode is seasom two episode three.</p>
<blockquote style="color:#B26100">"Yeah, well, you look beautiful, Cassie. You look [censor] amazing. It's literally all anyone's ever told you your entire life. Like, listen to yourself. It's [censor] exhausting."</blockquote>
<h1>Fezco</h1>
<a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/best-euphoria-quotes/movie-and-tv-quotes"><img src="img/fez.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a>
	<p>Fez is the best character ever. He is so funny and awkward. Him and Lexi are so adorable, when they met it was the best scene of the entire show. Even though he's a drug dealer and is blamed by Rue for the reason she's an addict. He still cares a lot for his love ones. There's a scene where Rue is in a bad place and begs him for drugs and he refused to open the door because he knows that she needs to get clean. Fez was taken in by his grandmother at a young age, she raised him. He has a little brother named Ashtray aka Ash. They rely heavily on each other, they have a lot of respect for each other and see each other as equals. The same was as in his back story episode, season two episode one, when his grandmother calls him her business partner rather than some kid. Fezco was very good at math due to growing up a drug dealer but had to drop out to take care of Ash while his grandmother was sick. Now he takes care of her in a hospital bed in his house. That shows that even though he lives a hard life-style he still makes time to care for people. That said, him and Ash aren't afraid to do some damage if they have to.</p>
